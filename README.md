Barkley-PMS
===========

The Open Source Project Management System developed by a single highschool web developer to build a community.


Barkley-PMS is a project management system built for the purpose of organization and collaboration between team members.
Barkley has came as far a being a single website able to be incorporated into any part of an existing website. It can be
edited to be apart of many hardcoded admin systems.

Barkley is unique to me. Because unlike many websites. Barkley lets you select an object before choosing what to do with it.
Its not okay click this to edit this project. Its select this... now here are your options to do that. So you get many
choices to edit things without making mistakes.

Barkley has evolved over time. It was set up so that you can have many projects with the same project ID but won't affect anything.
That has changed. project IDs are now sensitive. And can only belong to one project. 

Barkley selects a project.. and keeps that project ID in mind as you browse. So you never get the mistake of editing the wrong
project. It also tells you what task, project, or milestone is currently selected for you to edit. 

All the hard work is done in the backend. Most of the system is already completed. This was a project I was working on without 
Github but using github makes this project more organized and manageable.

Below you can find instructions on your first setup. Since the PHP file is currently underconstruction.
