Barkley-PMS
===========

The Open Source Project Management System

Barkley-PMS is a project management system built for the purpose of organization and collaboration between team members.
Barkley has came as far a being a single website able to be incorporated into any part of an existing website.

Barkley has evolved over time. It was set up so that you can have many projects with the same project ID but won't affect anything.

That has changed. project IDs are now sensitive. And can only belong to one project. 

Barkley selects a project.. and keeps that project ID in mind as you browse. So you never get the mistake of editing the wrong
project. It also tells you what task, project, or milestone is currently selected for you to edit.
